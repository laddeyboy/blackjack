# blackjack

This is a simple blackjack app that was programmed with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery.  This was my first experience with jQuery and targeting DOM elements.

Challenges that I faced:
1) This was an early experience with CSS and styling elements correctly was a challenge.
2) Also, I had a few challenges ensuring that I was targeting the correct elements with my jQuery statements and changing the DOM state to the continue the game play.

Stretch Goals:
I would like to create custom poker chip and card deck graphics.  I am using Gravit Designer to design unique poker chip grpahics that I can insert into the game.
